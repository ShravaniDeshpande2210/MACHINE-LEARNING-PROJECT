PREDICTION ON REVENUE FOR ICECREAM SHOP

This project involves building a machine learning model to study the relationship between temperature and revenue for an ice cream shop. Using a Decision Tree Regressor, the model predicts the shop's revenue based on the temperature on a particular day. The dataset consists of one independent variable (temp) representing the temperature and one dependent variable (revenue) representing the shop's earnings.

The project demonstrates how decision tree regression can be used for predictive analysis in a simple yet practical scenario. The code is written in Python, and popular libraries like scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib are utilized.
